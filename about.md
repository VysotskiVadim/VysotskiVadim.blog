Hi, I'm Vadzim Vysotski, software engineer from Minsk, Belarus.

I've started my career as a software engineer in 2014 and since then I've been working in different areas: backend, mobile, gamedev. Now my main focus is Android development. 

I often found it's a lot of things which doesn't get enough attentions in popular blogs and I don't know why. So I'll do it.

All I write in blog is for you, so your feedback is very appreciated, please do not hesitate contact me via any suitable channel for you: twitter, telegram, github, emails.
