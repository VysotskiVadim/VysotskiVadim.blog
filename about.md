Hi, I'm Vadzim Vysotski, a software engineer from Minsk, Belarus.

I've started my career as a software engineer in 2014,
then I've been working in different areas: backend, mobile, gamedev.
Now my main focus is Android development.

I often found it's a lot of things which don't get enough attention in popular blogs, and I don't know why.
So I'll blog about it.

All I write in blog is for you, so your feedback is very appreciated.
Please do not hesitate to contact me via any suitable channel for you: twitter, telegram, github, emails.
