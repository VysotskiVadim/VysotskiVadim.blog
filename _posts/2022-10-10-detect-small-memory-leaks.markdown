## TLDR;

Story of how I wrote [perfetto trace analyzer](https://gist.github.com/VysotskiVadim/31a3de8fd38729f179750b9dfed689e3) which verifies the absence of memory leaks in [Mapbox Navigation SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android).

## Introduction

Regular Android applications don't live long.
Users switch between them and OS kills unused ones.
Even if an application leaks a little memory, it usually doesn't cause a crash with `OutOfMemoryException` (OOM).

Some Android applications do live long.
I had a case with a navigator app that uses [Mapbox Navigation SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-navigation-android).
The app was always in the foreground.
Even a small memory leak could cause OOM after a day, a week, or a month.

## Detect small memory leak

Small memory leaks reveal themselves in constant memory growth over a long time.
It's not easy to detect it.
It's even harder to prove that there are no memory leaks.

I started by gathering information about the app's memory usage.

### Record long traces

I tried recording a long trace in Android Studio's profiler, but it didn't work out.
Android Studio becomes completely unresponsive after a few hours of recording.
You don't need any external tool to record memory traces.
[Android has supported the system's trace recording since version 9](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/tracing/on-device).

Prepare your phone for long traces.
Make sure it has some available space in memory.
Increase max trace size and length.
Record only memory-related activities to reduce trace file size.

Feel free to split the trace into a few files.
Stop recording and start it again.
I will show you later how to concatenate a few traces.

### Analyze trace

Download the trace from the phone and open it using [perfetto trace viewer](https://ui.perfetto.dev/).

Scroll the list and find your process.
I usually press *ctrl+f* and write the application package name.
Find the RSS chart of the process, it's a physical memory used by a process.
Read [this](https://perfetto.dev/docs/case-studies/memory#linux-memory-management) to know more about other values.

</div>

I'm looking at this chart... and...
I don't know if there is a memory leakðŸ¥².
RSS jumps up and down, even if there is a small memory growth it's easy not to notice it.

### Draw a chart

Let's try to draw a readable chart.
Perfetto provides instruments for trace analysis.
I'm going to use [queries](https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor) and [batch processor](https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/batch-trace-processor).

Based on [examples](https://perfetto.dev/docs/data-sources/memory-counters#sql) and [docs](https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/sql-tables) I built the following query to receive RSS over time:
```sql
select c.ts / 1000000 as timestamp, c.value / 1000 as rss from counter as c left join process_counter_track as t on c.track_id = t.id left join process as p using (upid) where t.name like 'mem.rss' and p.name like '{packageName}' order by c.ts
```

I have 36 hours of traces.
I stopped and started recording again a few times to analyze the intermediate result.
So it's not a single 36 hours trace, it's 3 traces of around 12 hours each. 

Use [the batch processor](https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/batch-trace-processor) to process a few traces in parallel.
Open all traces from the folder with traces.

```python
files = glob.glob(f'{tracesFolder}/*.perfetto-trace')
if (len(files) == 0):
    print(f"no trace files found in {tracesFolder}")
    exit()


print("loading:" + ' '.join(files))
with BatchTraceProcessor(files) as btp:
```

Request memory usage over time from each of them.
```python
rssMemorySets = btp.query(f"select c.ts / 1000000 as timestamp, c.value / 1000 as rss from counter as c left join process_counter_track as t on c.track_id = t.id left join process as p using (upid) where t.name like 'mem.rss' and p.name like '{packageName}' order by c.ts")
```

The batch trace processor returns a list of results, 1 result per 1 file.
Contact memory usage from different files and order by time:

```python
rssMemory = pandas.concat(rssMemorySets)
rssMemory.sort_values(by=['timestamp'], inplace=True)
```

Draw a chart with memory usage.
```python
rssMemory.plot(x='timestamp', y='rss')
```

<div style="overflow-x: auto; margin-bottom: 30px">
  <img
    height="596"
    width="3986"
    style="max-width: none"
    src="{{site.images.baseUrl}}/detect_memory_leak_custom_chart.jpg"
    alt="RSS chart in perfetto UI">
</div>


That's better but... it's still arguable.
Some people may say that chart is okay, some might see a leak.
Does it look okay to you?

### Trend line

The linear trend line may suggest how a value is going to change in the future.
Let's draw it to see if RSS is slowly growing.

It's time to remember some math from school.
A linear function can be defined by the equation `y = b * x + c`.
[Polyfit function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html) will help you find `b` and `c` for the trend line.
Pass your `x`(timestamp), `y`(memory), and 1 as a degree and you will get an array of `[ b, c ]`.
If coefficient `b`(first element of the array) is less than 0 trend line is decreasing, otherwise increasing.

```python
def drawTrendLine(dataFrame, xKey, yKey, color, label):
  ts = pandas.to_numeric(dataFrame[xKey])
  mem = pandas.to_numeric(dataFrame[yKey])
  coefficients = np.polyfit(ts, mem, 1)
  b = coefficients[0]
  print(f'{label} has coefficient {b:.20f}')
  p = np.poly1d(coefficients)
  plt.plot(ts, p(ts), color=color, label=label)
  plt.legend()
```

I have `rss trend line has coefficient -0.00000548365707914431` in the output.
It means that the trend line is flat.
Take a look at the trend line to check if the RSS values follow the calculated trend line.

## Thank you for reading

You can find the whole script on [Git Hub](https://gist.github.com/VysotskiVadim/31a3de8fd38729f179750b9dfed689e3).

If you have a similar problem, do not be afraid to write a custom tool.
It's easier than it seems, at least when you do it for the second time ðŸ˜….
