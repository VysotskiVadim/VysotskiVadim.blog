According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming):

> Generic programming is a style of computer programming in which algorithms are written in terms of types to-be-specified-later that are then instantiated when needed for specific types provided as parameters. 

i.e. you're adding one more layer of indirection: abstraction over concrete types in algorithms or data structures.

Add example!

I found fascinating how different programming languages implements Generic Programming, in post we consider popular now day strong typed languages. TODO: Why only strong typed?, is only strong typed?

For every considered language we will answer following questions:
* How does it work under the hood?
* How did migration to generic happen(if actual)?
* How Variance works?
* What about known issues?
