## Why

I operated with string resources in a view model to implement logic around text formatting.
Requirements were with respect to available data concatenate a few plurals.
For example: show how many time left before a certain date.
Depends on a time left output could be: *"1 day", "6 days", "7 month 4 days", etc*...

I wanted to keep the logic in a view model because of unit testing.
If I kept the logic in a view I wouldn't be able to test using fast and reliable unit tests.

## Popular but not working solution {#resource-provider}

Popular solution is to use `Context` directly or to create abstraction around it.
You can see examples in the
[answers on the Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47628646/how-should-i-get-resourcesr-string-in-viewmodel-in-android-mvvm-and-databindi).

Given approach doesn't handle changes of a phone language.
View model isn't recreated when user changes phone's language, but view is.
After configuration change view model will contain text from for previous locale while view will display text for a new one.
You can reed more about the issue [in the article by Jose Alc√©rreca](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/locale-changes-and-the-androidviewmodel-antipattern-84eb677660d9)

## Solution that works

Don't keep text from resources in a view model.
Keep a resource id:
```kotlin
data class Resource(@StringRes val id: Int) : NativeText()
```
and get text by resource id on UI:
```kotlin
context.getString(id)
```


For string resource with arguments keep resource id and arguments:
```kotlin
data class Arguments(@StringRes val id: Int, val args: List<Any>) : NativeText()
```
and get text on UI:
```kotlin
context.getString(id, *args.toTypedArray())
```

For plurals keep plural id, number, and arguments:
```kotlin
data class Plural(@PluralsRes val id: Int, val number: Int, val args: List<Any>) : NativeText()
```
and get text on UI:
```kotlin
context.resources.getQuantityString(id, number, *args.toTypedArray())
```

Did you notice that all classes from example extend `NativeText`?

Instead of concatenation keep a list of `NativeText`:
```kotlin
  data class Multi(val text: List<NativeText>) : NativeText()
```
and concatenate strings on UI:
```kotlin
val builder = StringBuilder()
for (t in text) {
    builder.append(t.toCharSequence(context))
}
builder.toString()
```

Put it all together and you will get `NativeText.kt`:
```kotlin
sealed class NativeText {
    data class Simple(val text: String) : NativeText()
    data class Resource(@StringRes val id: Int) : NativeText()
    data class Plural(@PluralsRes val id: Int, val number: Int, val args: List<Any>) : NativeText()
    data class Arguments(@StringRes val id: Int, val args: List<Any>) : NativeText()
    data class Multi(val text: List<NativeText>) : NativeText()
}

fun NativeText.toCharSequence(context: Context): CharSequence {
    return when (this) {
        is NativeText.Arguments -> context.getString(id, *args.toTypedArray())
        is NativeText.Multi -> {
            val builder = StringBuilder()
            for (t in text) {
                builder.append(t.toCharSequence(context))
            }
            builder.toString()
        }
        is NativeText.Plural -> context.resources.getQuantityString(id, number, *args.toTypedArray())
        is NativeText.Resource -> context.getString(id)
        is NativeText.Simple -> text
    }
}
```

### Unit testing

Unit testing is straight forward because view model doesn't interact with an Android Framework.
Just compare view model filed with expected resource.

```kotlin
@Test
fun `map movie that will be released tomorrow`() {
    val mapper = createMapper()
    val movie = createMovie(releaseDate = LocalDate.of(2021, Month.SEPTEMBER, 30))

    val listItem = mapper.map(movie)

    assertEquals(
        NativeText.Plural(R.plurals.movies_list_days_before_release, 1, listOf(1)),
        listItem.release
    )
}
```

The test isn't perfect.
In ideal world I would prefer to see `assertEquals("1 day before release", listItem.release)`
but location mechanism isn't available on JVM.
All we can test is parameters for specific case: resource ids, arguments, etc.


## Conclusion

`NativeText` is the best solution I've know so far.
It fits Android UI lifecycle and easily testable.
