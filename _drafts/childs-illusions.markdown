The first step of learning new things is to start doing it by following rules given by teachers.
You don't ask why, it's too much materials to knew at the beginning.
After a while when you get some knowledge you start looking deep at the area.
Your main question now is **why**.
Usually after many **why**s you find out that there is no approach which is just *right*.
There are many approaches which can lead you to success.
They are just different, with different pros and cons.
People who are aware of the majority of ways to success in their field,
and know which one suits given situation better are called an experts.

I often meet smart people, who don't want to go further than following without asking why.
They stick to idea that in the world something which is *"right"*,
so that if you act in different way they call it *"wrong"*.
They see only one approach and don't even want to consider others.
I found a theory in Transactional Analysis, which explains this phenomenon.

## Transactional Analysis (TODO: rewrite)

Transactional analysis (TA) is a psychoanalytic theory and method of therapy wherein social transactions are analyzed to determine the ego state of the patient (whether parent-like, childlike, or adult-like) as a basis for understanding behavior. In transactional analysis, the patient is taught to alter the ego state as a way to solve emotional problems. The method deviates from Freudian psychoanalysis which focuses on increasing awareness of the contents of unconsciously held ideas. Eric Berne developed the concept and paradigm of transactional analysis in the late 1950s.

## The ego state (TODO: rewrite)
You as a person consist of at least 3 different personalities --
[Child, Adult, and Parent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_analysis#The_ego-state_(or_Parent%E2%80%93Adult%E2%80%93Child_(PAC))_models), also known as an ego states:
* Parent: a state in which people behave, feel, and think in response to an unconscious mimicking of how their parents (or other parental figures) acted, or how they interpreted their parent's actions. For example, a person may shout at someone out of frustration because they learned from an influential figure in childhood the lesson that this seemed to be a way of relating that worked.
* Adult: a state of the ego which is most like an artificially intelligent system processing information and making predictions about major emotions that could affect its operation. While a person is in the Adult ego state, he/she is directed towards an objective appraisal of reality.
* Child: a state in which people behave, feel, and think similarly to how they did in childhood. For example, a person who receives a poor evaluation at work may respond by looking at the floor and crying or pouting, as when scolded as a child. Conversely, a person who receives a good evaluation may respond with a broad smile and a joyful gesture of thanks. The Child is the source of emotions, creation, recreation, spontaneity, and intimacy.

Child is one of the most valuable state in us -- it makes us creative, makes us alive.
Eric Bern use Child, where first letter is upper case, to talk about ego state, so do I.

## Illusions

From the earliest childhood we'd been thought a simple rule: *"Do what I said and you'll be fine."*
All of us heard that from parents, and we believe it.
This is an example of illusion.
Child inside us believes in illusions despite your age.

Illusions can be different: *if I wan the lottery I will be make my dream come true and will be happy*.
People are waisting all live waiting for the miracle.
Every game miracle happens for at least one person.
But usually he finds out that things he can buy doesn't make them happy,
because this things are real, not magic like in their illusions.
The majority of winners waist all money and return back to regular live.
This happens because all the system of illusions is built on top of magic.
Prize should appear by magic, and it should be magical.
Child always became disappointed when he see the real things when magic was expected.

One of the most illustrative example of illusion is nazis.
Hitler promised them the Greater German Reich if they kill all other nations.
This promise and strong believe made them immortal and all-powerful during genocide of civilians of different nations.
Despite the fact that they committed a horrible crime they consider it as an act of love,
their Child believed
*"If you do as I say, I will love and protect you, you're nothing without me."*
But reality beat their believe -- they were defeated during the WW2.

It's hard to overcome Child believe,
in most cases it's impossible.
Take a look at young polish boy,
who doesn't understand why german soldiers put a gun against him,
he did as his mummy said, he shouldn't be hurt:

## Magical code

In the software development industry we have many people who are really good at selling ideas(Uncle Bob for example).
Let's call people like them industry giants.
When giants sell ideas they usually skip important part: the area of applicability.
It would be boring and probably impossible to mention all the preconditions during the talk.
Our Child gets new illusion: *If I do as industry giants say, I will be a successful developer.*
We're looking for magic which will protect us in the complicated world of software development.
Even in case of failure we tend to think that *I didn't managed to do as giants said*
or *I did as giant said, it's not my failure*.
Acting like that we hope that giant take care of us, our project, and our career success.

## The reality

In real world, where we live, magic doesn't exist.
So if your idea is based on magic it will probably fail...
Or maybe not.
It can so happen that you'll luckily reach your destination following the white rabbit.
As I said before there is a many ways which leads you to success.

{% include image.html src="paths_to_success" alt="many path to success" %}

None of them is "right" and none of them is "wrong".
They are different.
Direct will lead you to success fast.
But not direct can be more funny and give you more experience.

## Let the Adult rule

When you code for money you want to act as a professional.
Professional solves people's problem.
He solve it in the most effective way.
Professional doesn't sell not direct ways to get a fun during his work.

The Adult ego state is professional inside us.
It makes decisions based on analysis.
But it's not easy to make it the ruler of your life.
All transactional analysis is about giving the Adult more power.

For me working strategy was just start acting as a professional.
I don't do anything until I answer myself **Why am I doing it?**.
Everything is in my hands.
I'm responsible for my project, my code, and my life.
Guys from the book won't protect me.

But don't get me wrong.
Guys who I call industry giants are really smart.
The know why and when you can get benefits from approaches which they sell.
The main idea it that you **have** to know it too.
Otherwise you success will be based on magic, which in real world nothing more than a luck.
