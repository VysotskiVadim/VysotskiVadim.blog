## Into

I bought the "Test Driven Development: By Example" by Kent Beck on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095SQ9WP4/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_56ZFZYAG5RRE5356BWB8) for kindle.
While reading the book I wrote a few notes which I'd like to share.

Notes are just a few ideas I took away from the book, nothing more.
They don't represent or substitute the book.
The "Money" and "XUnit" examples are the most valuable things I found in this book.
I do recommend you to see how Kent develops using TDD and shares his thought meanwhile.
I noticed changes in my tests after reading this book.

## Notes

The more stress you have the less testing you do.
The less testing you do the more errors you make.
The more errors you make the more stress you have.
It's a loop that makes your state worse each iteration.

Automatic tests could break the cycle.
The more stress you have the more tests you write and run.
The more tests you run and write the fewer errors you make.
The fewer errors you make the less stress you have.

Tests that you get out of the TDD cycle donâ€™t cover all testing for a project.
However, TDD affects the way you test.
When your code becomes stable enough, a professional tester could get enough time for usability, exploratory, and other types of testing.

How to improve tests coverage?
An obvious option is to add more tests to cover all possible inputs/cases/states.
The other option is to simplify the logic.
Decrease the count of possible cases/states/inputs on the refactoring step.
You will get better tests coverage with the same set of tests.
