title:  Don't use Jetpack Pagination
description: "Why I'm unhappy using Jatpack pagination library."
---

I like libraries provided by Google in Jetpack suite.
Libs do their work, and do it well, stable and fast.
I trusted they so much so when I faced task of showing paged result,
I didn't have any doubts to use [Jetpack Paging library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging).
It was a mistake.
During the usage of Jetpack Paging library I had experienced many technical challenges because of it.
So this article not just a nagging about my pain,
it also includes workaround which I used.
If you use Jetpack Paging I believe you'll find them useful.
