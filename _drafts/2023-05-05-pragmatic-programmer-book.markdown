# Introduction

> “The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.”  
-- George Orwell

I have read the ["Pragmatic Programmer"](https://a.co/d/6TqIgPl) book and would like to share a few ideas/concepts that resonated with me.
I had been thinking about those ideas before I even started reading the book.
The book provided me with missing pieces of the puzzle to see a bigger picture, to finally understand solutions that had been floating in the air.

The book covers many aspects of programming, and I'm certain that every developer finds their pieces of a puzzle that are relevant to their problems and experience.


# Takeaways from the book

The ideas are ordered by value.

### What's a pragmatic programmer goal?

Be a problem solver

Delight your user. Ask how to understand success of the project
Sometimes requirements are Guesses.

The goal it's using a technique, the goal is to deliver good software.

A bug free system that answers wrong question isn't useful.

### Work with others

Build the code, not your ego. Try to understand others viewpoint, difference isn't wrong.

### Small steps

Good enough software today is better than perfect software tomorrow.
Don't be scare to throw prototype away

Perfection is when it's nothing to take away

Help people understand what they want in a feed back loop: explain consequences, edge cases, show mockups, prototypes. Try to be a customer to realize what it feels like


### What to learn?

Investing in knowledge like investing in finance 

### Good code

Every principle is about easier to change

Decoupling 

Inheritance tax

TDD won't help if you don't have destination in your head

Buy auth providers, they 

Property based tests often surprise you

Team structure dictates the way code looks like.

### Soft skills

Estimation unit represents certancy
Estimate with a range of scenarios 

Software is like gardening, not building

Clients don't read detailed specifications, it's for developers to explain what they are doing.

Requirements are need, not a design, not a user interface.

Identity real, not imaginative constraints. Find a bigger box. Example with a trojan horse.
