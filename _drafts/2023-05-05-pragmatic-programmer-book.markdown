### The book

> “The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.”  
-- George Orwell

I have read the ["Pragmatic Programmer"](https://a.co/d/6TqIgPl) book and would like to share a few ideas/concepts that resonated with me.
I had been thinking about those ideas before I even started reading the book.
The book provided me with missing pieces of the puzzle to see a bigger picture, to finally understand solutions that had been floating in the air.

The book covers many aspects of programming, and I'm certain that every developer finds their pieces of a puzzle that are relevant to their problems and experience.


### Takeaways

Good enough software today is better than perfect software tomorrow.


Investing in knowledge like investing in finance 


Every principle is about easier to change


Decoupling 


Estimation unit represents certancy


Estimate with a range of scenarios 


Don't be scare to throw prototype away


Inheritance tax


Software is like gardening, not building


TDD won't help if you don't have destination in your head


Property based tests often surprise you


Buy auth providers, they 


Perfection is when it's nothing to take away


Help people understand what they want in a feed back loop: explain consequences, edge cases, show mockups, prototypes. Try to be a customer to realize what it feels like


Clients don't read detailed specifications, it's for developers to explain what they are doing.

Requirements are need, not a design, not a user interface.

Identity real, not imaginative constraints. Find a bigger box. Example with a trojan horse.

Team structure dictates the way code looks like.

Build the code, not your ego. Try to understand others viewpoint, difference isn't wrong.

The goal it's using a technique, the goal is to deliver good software.

A bug free system that answers wrong question isn't useful.

Delight your user. Ask how to understand success of the project
Sometimes requirements are Guesses.

Be a problem solver
