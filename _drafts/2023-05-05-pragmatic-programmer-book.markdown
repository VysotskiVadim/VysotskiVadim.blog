### The book

> “The best books... are those that tell you what you know already.”  
-- George Orwell

I have read the ["Pragmatic Programmer"](https://a.co/d/6TqIgPl) book and would like to share a few ideas/concepts that resonated with me.
I had been thinking about those ideas before I even started reading the book.
The book provided me with missing pieces of the puzzle to see a bigger picture, to finally understand solutions that had been floating in the air.

The book covers many aspects of programming, and I'm certain that every developer finds their pieces of a puzzle that are relevant to their problems and experience.
