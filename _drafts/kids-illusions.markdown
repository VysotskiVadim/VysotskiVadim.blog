The first step of learning new things is to start doing it by following rules given by teachers.
You don't ask why, it's too much materials to knew at the beginning.
After a while when you got some knowledge you start looking deep at the area.
Your main question now is **why**.
Usually after many **why**s you find out that there is no approach which is just *right*.
There are many approaches, and all of them lead you to success.
They are just different, with different pros and cons.
People who are aware of the majority of ways to success in their field,
and know which one suits given situation better are called an experts.

I often meet smart people, who don't want to go further than following.
They stick to idea that in the world something which is *"right"*,
so that if you act in different way they call it *"wrong"*.
They see only one approach and don't even want to consider others.
I found a theory in Transactional Analysis, which explains this phenomenon.

## Transactional Analysis



## The ego states
You as a person consist of at least 3 different personalities --
[Child, Adult, and Parent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transactional_analysis#The_ego-state_(or_Parent%E2%80%93Adult%E2%80%93Child_(PAC))_models), also known as an ego states:
* Parent: a state in which people behave, feel, and think in response to an unconscious mimicking of how their parents (or other parental figures) acted, or how they interpreted their parent's actions. For example, a person may shout at someone out of frustration because they learned from an influential figure in childhood the lesson that this seemed to be a way of relating that worked.
* Adult: a state of the ego which is most like an artificially intelligent system processing information and making predictions about major emotions that could affect its operation. While a person is in the Adult ego state, he/she is directed towards an objective appraisal of reality.
* Child: a state in which people behave, feel, and think similarly to how they did in childhood. For example, a person who receives a poor evaluation at work may respond by looking at the floor and crying or pouting, as when scolded as a child. Conversely, a person who receives a good evaluation may respond with a broad smile and a joyful gesture of thanks. The Child is the source of emotions, creation, recreation, spontaneity, and intimacy.

Child is one of the most valuable state in us -- it makes us creative, makes us alive.
Eric Bern(founder of Transactional Analysis) use Child, where first letter is upper case, to talk about ego state, so do I.

## Illusions

From the earliest childhood we'd been thought a simple rule: *"Do what I said and you'll be fine."*
All of us heard that from parents, and we believe it.
This is an example of illusion.
Child inside us believes in illusions despite your age.

Illusions can be different: *if I wan the lottery I will be make my dream come true and will be happy*.
People are waisting all live waiting for the miracle.
Every game miracle happens for one person.
But usually he finds out that things he can buy doesn't make them happy,
because this things are real, not magic like in their illusions.
The majority of winners waist all money and return back to regular live.
This happens because all the system of illusions is built on top of magic.
Price shouldn't just appeared by magic, it should be magical.
Child always became disappointed when he see the real things when magic was expected.

One of the most illustrative example is nazis.
Hitler promised them the Greater German Reich if they kill all other nations.
This promise and strong believe made them immortal and all-powerful during genocide of civilians of different nations.
Despite the fact that they committed a horrible crime they consider it as an act of love,
their Child believed
*"If you do as I say, I will love and protect you, you're nothing without me."*
But reality beat their believe -- they loose.
It's hard to overcome Child believe
*(take a look at young polish boy who doesn't understand why german soldiers put a gun against him, he did as his mummy said, he shouldn't be hurt: [photo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Stroop_Report_-_Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising_06.jpg))*.

## Magic and code

In the software development industry we have many people who really good at selling ideas(Uncle Bob for example).
Let's call people like them industry giants.
When giants sells ideas they usually skip important part: the area of applicability.
It would be boring and probably impossible to mention all the preconditions during the talk.
Our Child gets new illusion: *If I do as industry giants say, I will be a successful developer.*
We're looking for magic which will protect us in the complicated world of software development.
Even in case of failure we tend to think that *I didn't managed to do as giants said*
or *I did as giant said, it's not my failure*.

## Let's the Adult rule

Everything is your hands.
You're the responsible for your project, for your code.
Gyu from the book won't protect you.
Analyze, ask your self the question **Why am I doing it?**.
Ask giants **Why**, they're smart and know the answer, just don't want to bother you with enormous amount of ifs and whens.
